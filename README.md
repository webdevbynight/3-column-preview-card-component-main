## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (via SCSS)
  - custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - pseudo-classes
  - pseudo-elements
  - CSS sprite
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I put the three icons into a single SVG file used as a CSS sprite, in order to serve the background images and save two HTTP requests.

### Continued development

I still have to learn about how to make front-end development in a more efficient way and to learn to manage to build web pages without seeming to be too slow.
